    // Alice is opening a bookstore and wants to create a tracking system.
    // She will sell kids books, recipe books, novels and comics.
    // She has 10 of them each.
    // She wants to calculate how many books are left after each transaction.

    /** task 1: create 4 static int variables for each book type and equal it to 10 **/

            // variable kids
            // variable recipe
            // variable novels
            // variable comics

    /** task 2: create 4 methods named soldKids, soldRecipe, soldNovels, and soldComics.
    // for each method, have a parameter of int soldNum and subtract that number from the corresponding book count.
    // print "kids books left: ...", have void return type, have an int parameter as int soldNum **/

            // method 1: soldKids
            // method 2: soldRecipe
            // method 3: soldNovels
